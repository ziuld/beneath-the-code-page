# Ordered execution queue

One active task at a time. The order includes owner capacity, not only technical dependencies. Dates are not commitments. Read the linked feature/story before starting its first task.

**No unblocked selected task is ready; inspect recorded prerequisites and blockers.**

Unfinished tasks follow the selected V2 phase order. The remaining course stories are deferred; accepted V1 tasks are excluded.

## V2 delivery sequence

Only listed stories are selected for this sequence. F15-UH03 through UH07 remain deferred; completing the full course is not a release gate. Estimates are provisional owner hours, not deadlines. V1 acceptance remains historical; portable V1 handoff is an additional deliverable tracked in V2.

| Phase | Selected stories | Forecast hours | Exit / checkpoint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| V2-P1 — Security maintenance and stale documentation | F17-UH01 | 8 | Current security findings and documentation verified; unresolved findings remain explicit. |
| V2-P2 — Two additional Java lessons | F15-UH01, F15-UH02 | 24 | Values/types/numeric limits and control flow/tracing reviewed in EN/ES/FR. Then push the scoped changes and open the first PR; complete this checkpoint before design exploration. |
| V2-P3 — Agree and implement the design page by page | F18-UH01 | 12 | Learn first, then course/unit, Tools/workspace and Home/shared shell. Owner-generated Nano Banana concepts and explicit agreement precede implementation. |
| V2-P4 — Complete the remaining tools | F08-UH01, F09-UH01, F10-UH01, F11-UH01, F11-UH02 | 42 | Base64, UUID, JWT and bounded JSON/YAML conversion accepted individually after final design agreement. |
| V2-P5 — Final frontend compatibility review | F19-UH01 | 8 | Chromium/Firefox/WebKit results and separate real Safari evidence or pending limitation; demonstrated defects triaged without false coverage claims. |
| V2-P6 — Docker Desktop portability and final handoff | F20-UH01 | 8 | Single-app container and second-PC runbook verified; actual second-PC evidence and owner closure, or an explicit pending item. No automatic image publication or deployment. |

Selected remaining V2 forecast: 70.5h + 14.1h contingency = 84.6 owner hours at 10h/week. Provisional capacity budget, not a delivery commitment. Zero actual hours means unreported effort.
