# Ordered execution queue

One active task at a time. The order includes owner capacity, not only technical dependencies. Dates are not commitments. Read the linked feature/story before starting its first task.

**No unblocked V1 task is ready; inspect recorded prerequisites and blockers.**

Only unfinished V1 tasks are scheduled. Accepted work and frozen V2 tasks remain in the feature dossiers.
